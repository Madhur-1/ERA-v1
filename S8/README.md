# Session 7

## Aim
Achieve 99.4% Test Accuracy in 15 epochs or less with an 8000 parameter or less model.

## Approach
We do six iterations starting from a baseline from the previous assignment taking steps towards the aim. The models are specified in the `model.py` file
numbered from Net1 to Net6.

There are six other files `Net1.ipynb` to `Net6.ipynb` which are responsible for running and testing the models. They also contain the Target, Results and Analysis after each run.

The `utils.py` file contains the additional methods required for the model training.
