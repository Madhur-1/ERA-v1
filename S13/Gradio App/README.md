# YOLOv3 Object Detection Explorer

Welcome to the YOLOv3 Object Detection Explorer! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîç

Uncover the magic of object detection through our interactive Gradio app, powered by the cutting-edge YOLOv3 model. With a focus on flexibility and precision, this app lets you explore the world of computer vision like never before.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv3 at Your Fingertips**: Immerse yourself in the realm of object detection with our YOLOv3 model. Crafted meticulously from scratch using the Pascal VOC dataset's 20 distinct classes, our model guarantees accurate and robust object detection.

- **Insights with GradCAM**: Experience the brilliance of GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), a revolutionary technique that peers into the inner workings of the model. By harnessing gradients, it uncovers the precise regions within an image that heavily influence the classification score, offering a deeper understanding of the model's decisions.

- **Tailored Detection Streams**: With three distinct output streams, each providing sizes of 13x13, 26x26, and 52x52, you can adapt your approach based on the size of the objects in focus. Opt for smaller outputs to capture larger objects or opt for larger outputs for finer details.

## How It Works

1. Upload an image you'd like to analyze for object detection.
2. Select the output stream that aligns with your object detection needs.
3. Watch as our YOLOv3 model efficiently identifies and annotates objects within the image.
4. Dive deeper into the process by exploring the GradCAM visualization, shedding light on the pivotal regions driving the model's classification.

## Explore and Learn
